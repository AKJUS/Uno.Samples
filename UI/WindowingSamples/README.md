This sample showcases various windowing APIs in Uno Platform a .NET project focused on demonstrating various window management techniques. This project includes examples of custom windows, full-screen mode, minimizing and maximizing windows, and more. It provides a comprehensive guide for developers looking to implement advanced windowing features in their .NET applications.
