# Windows Community Toolkit DataGrid Sample

This is a simple standalone app demonstrating the [Windows Community Toolkit `DataGrid` control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/datagrid) integrated into an [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) app and using [Windows Community Toolkit Version 7.x](../../README.md).

The `DataGrid` XAML code and model data is taken from the [WCT Samples App](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.WindowsCommunityToolkit/blob/uno/CommunityToolkit.WinUI.SampleApp/SamplePages/DataGrid/DataGridCode.bind).

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on how to use Windows Community Toolkit, a complete tutorial is available for [Windows Community Toolkit Version 7.x with the `DataGrid` control as an example](https://aka.platform.uno/install-uno-community-toolkit).
