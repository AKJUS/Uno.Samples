# Windows Community Toolkit Samples

The [Windows Community Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/) is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer patterns when building experiences for Windows.

Depending on the version of the Windows Community Toolkit you want to use, the samples below provide examples of implementation:

- **[For WCT version 8.x](Version-8.x/UnoWCTSettingsCardSample):** This sample showcases the `SettingsCard` control, but the same implementation can be followed for any of the Windows Community Toolkit components supported out of the box.
- **[For WCT version 7.x](Version-7.x/UnoWCTDataGridSample):** This sample showcases the `DataGrid` control, but the same implementation can be followed for any of the Uno ported Windows Community Toolkit components.
