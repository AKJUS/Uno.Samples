The app showcases F# integration with C# MVUX models, and can be run on all platforms, such as Desktop, WebAssembly, iOS, Android.

# Prompt

Copilot was prompted with the following: `Create a uno platform project where an F# record is defined and can be used with MVUX from Uno. Create a page that showcases this, with a F# record, reference it from a C# Uno app, bind to it via MVUX.`

Then, as a follow-up: `Create a more interactive page showcasing F# + MVUX.`

## Features

* **F# Records**: Demonstrates simple records and nested records defined in F#
* **MVUX Integration**: Shows how F# types work seamlessly with [MVUX](https://aka.platform.uno/mvux) state management
* **Type Safety**: Leverages F#'s type system while maintaining interoperability with C# code
* **Interactive Examples**: Includes State and Feed demonstrations with F# models
