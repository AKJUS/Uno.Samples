# What is the Uno Platform

The Uno Platform (Pronounced 'Oono' or 'Ouno') is a Universal Windows Platform Bridge that allows UWP-based code (C# and XAML) to run on iOS, Android, macOS, and WebAssembly. It provides the full definitions of the UWP [Windows 10 2004 (19041)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/whats-new/windows-10-build-19041), and the implementation of a growing number of parts of the UWP API, such as **Windows.UI.Xaml**, to enable UWP and WinUI applications to run on these platforms.

Use the UWP/WinUI tooling from Windows in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), such as [XAML Edit and Continue](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/04/06/ui-development-made-easier-with-xaml-edit-continue/) and [C# Edit and Continue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-edit-and-continue-csharp), build your application as much as possible on Windows, then validate that your application runs on iOS, Android, macOS and WebAssembly.
