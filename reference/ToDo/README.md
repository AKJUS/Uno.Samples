# Uno Platform "Uno To Do" reference app
`Uno To Do` is a beautifully designed sample app for [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) using the latest [Material Design 3 system](https://m3.material.io/).

The design template makes it easy to jump-start or learn Uno Platform-powered mobile, web, and desktop applications. The app provides common functions such as logging on, recording tasks, adding due dates, setting reminders, and more.

In addition, the sample code utilizes [Uno.Extensions](https://aka.platform.uno/uno-extensions) and establishes the best practices for cross-platform application design and development considering multiple screen sizes, accessibility, enforcing brand guidelines, and more.
